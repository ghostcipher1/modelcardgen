model_name: "Email Spam Classifier"
model_version: "2.1.0"
model_description: |
  A machine learning model that classifies emails as spam or legitimate 
  based on textual features and header information. Uses a gradient boosted 
  decision tree ensemble trained on historical email data.

model_license: "Apache-2.0"
model_framework: "scikit-learn"

training_data_name: "Enron Email Corpus"
training_data_description: |
  A large collection of real email messages with manually labeled spam 
  and legitimate categories. Collected from Enron employees' mailboxes 
  and supplemented with public spam databases.

training_data_features:
  - "subject_line"
  - "body_text"
  - "sender_domain"
  - "header_features"
  - "attachment_count"
  - "recipient_count"
training_data_target: "spam_label"

eval_data_name: "Recent Email Dataset"
eval_data_description: |
  A holdout test set from more recent emails to evaluate temporal robustness. 
  Collected from the same source systems as training data but from a later 
  time period to assess model drift.
eval_data_size: 50000
eval_data_features:
  - "subject_line"
  - "body_text"
  - "sender_domain"
  - "header_features"
  - "attachment_count"
  - "recipient_count"

  - "Blocking legitimate user email"
  - "Discriminatory filtering based on sender identity"
  - "Automated enforcement without human oversight"
  - "Use in safety-critical or life-altering decisions"

risks:
  - risk_type: "Domain-Specific Performance"
    description: |
      Model was trained on Enron corpus (2000s) and may not capture 
      modern spam patterns. Spam tactics have evolved significantly, 
      including use of AI-generated content and sophisticated phishing.
    mitigation_strategy: |
      Retrain quarterly with recent email data. Monitor performance 
      metrics continuously. Maintain feedback loop with security team 
      to identify emerging patterns.
    severity: "Medium"
  
  - risk_type: "Language Bias"
    description: |
      Training data contains primarily English emails. Non-English 
      emails may have degraded performance or unpredictable behavior.
    mitigation_strategy: |
      Collect and evaluate performance on non-English email samples. 
      Consider separate models for major non-English languages. Document 
      supported languages clearly.
    severity: "Low"
  
  - risk_type: "Data Drift"
    description: |
      Email patterns and user behavior evolve over time. Distribution 
      shift in production data may cause performance degradation.
    mitigation_strategy: |
      Implement continuous monitoring of key metrics. Set alerts for 
      accuracy drop below 94%. Trigger retraining when drift is detected.
    severity: "Medium"
  
  - risk_type: "False Positive Impact"
    description: |
      Misclassifying legitimate emails as spam causes user frustration 
      and potential loss of important messages (invoices, alerts, notifications).
    mitigation_strategy: |
      Tune decision threshold to minimize false positives. Implement 
      email recovery/appeal features. Monitor false positive rate daily.
    severity: "Medium"
  
  - risk_type: "Adversarial Robustness"
    description: |
      Model may be vulnerable to adversarially crafted emails designed 
      to evade detection. Sophisticated attackers can adapt to learned patterns.
    mitigation_strategy: |
      Implement ensemble methods with multiple models. Maintain feedback 
      loop for false negatives. Test against adversarial examples quarterly.
    severity: "High"
